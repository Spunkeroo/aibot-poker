      <p class="subtitle">From Libratus shocking the poker world in 2017 to the GTO solvers every serious player uses today, artificial intelligence has permanently transformed how poker is played, studied, and won. This is the complete guide to understanding AI poker strategy and using it to improve your own game in 2026.</p>

    <article class="article-content">

      <p>Poker has always been a game of incomplete information. Unlike chess, where every piece is visible on the board, poker forces you to make decisions with hidden cards, deceptive opponents, and a healthy dose of uncertainty. For decades, the best poker players relied on intuition, experience, and psychological reads to gain an edge. Then artificial intelligence arrived and rewrote the entire playbook.</p>

      <p>The transformation started making headlines in 2017 when Carnegie Mellon University's <strong>Libratus</strong> defeated four top professional poker players in a 20-day heads-up No-Limit Texas Hold'em challenge, winning over $1.7 million in chips. Two years later, the same research group unveiled <strong>Pluribus</strong>, which achieved superhuman performance in six-player poker &mdash; a far more complex challenge that many researchers believed was years away from being solved. These breakthroughs did not just advance computer science. They fundamentally changed how human poker players think about and study the game.</p>

      <p>Today, in 2026, the influence of AI on poker is everywhere. Professional players spend hours each day working with GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solvers. Training platforms powered by machine learning analyze millions of hands to identify leaks in your game. Recreational players who have never heard of "Nash equilibrium" are unknowingly using strategies that were discovered by AI. Whether you are a casual home game player, a grinder at the microstakes, or aspiring to compete at the World Series of Poker, understanding how AI has shaped modern poker strategy is no longer optional &mdash; it is essential.</p>

      <h2>A Brief History of AI in Poker</h2>

      <p>The quest to build a poker-playing AI stretches back further than most people realize. The challenge was always fundamentally different from board games like chess or Go. Poker involves <strong>imperfect information</strong> &mdash; you cannot see your opponents' cards &mdash; plus elements of randomness, bluffing, and multi-player dynamics that make it extraordinarily difficult for traditional game-solving approaches.</p>

      <h3>The Early Days: Limit Hold'em</h3>

      <p>The University of Alberta's Computer Poker Research Group began working on poker AI in the 1990s. Their program <strong>Loki</strong> (1998) was one of the first serious attempts, using opponent modeling and simulation-based strategies. By 2007, their successor program <strong>Polaris</strong> was competitive enough to challenge professional players in a limited format. Then in 2015, their program <strong>Cepheus</strong> essentially "solved" heads-up Limit Texas Hold'em, computing a near-perfect strategy for the entire game. This was a remarkable theoretical achievement, but Limit Hold'em is a relatively constrained format with fixed bet sizes. The real challenge &mdash; No-Limit Hold'em, with its infinite possible bet sizes and far larger game tree &mdash; was still waiting.</p>

      <h3>Libratus: The Breakthrough (2017)</h3>

      <p>Carnegie Mellon's <strong>Libratus</strong>, developed by Tuomas Sandholm and Noam Brown, was the watershed moment. In a heads-up No-Limit Hold'em match against four of the best human players in the world &mdash; Jason Les, Dong Kim, Daniel McAulay, and Jimmy Chou &mdash; Libratus played 120,000 hands over 20 days and won decisively, accumulating over $1.7 million in chips with a statistically significant margin.</p>

      <p>What made Libratus revolutionary was its approach. Rather than trying to model opponents and exploit their weaknesses (as earlier poker AIs had done), Libratus used a technique called <strong>counterfactual regret minimization (CFR)</strong> to compute a near-Nash equilibrium strategy. In simpler terms, it played in a way that was mathematically unexploitable, regardless of what its opponents did. It also used a nested subgame solving technique that allowed it to compute real-time strategies for specific situations during play, rather than relying entirely on pre-computed strategies.</p>

      <blockquote>"Libratus didn't win by reading our tells or exploiting our weaknesses. It won because its strategy was essentially perfect. We couldn't find a consistent way to beat it." &mdash; Jason Les, professional poker player</blockquote>

      <h3>Pluribus: Multi-Player Mastery (2019)</h3>

      <p>If Libratus shocked the poker world, <strong>Pluribus</strong> stunned it. Developed by Noam Brown (now at Meta AI) and Tuomas Sandholm, Pluribus achieved superhuman performance in <strong>six-player No-Limit Hold'em</strong> &mdash; a game exponentially more complex than heads-up play. With multiple opponents, the concept of a Nash equilibrium becomes much harder to compute and less clearly defined.</p>

      <p>Pluribus used a modified version of the Monte Carlo CFR algorithm for its blueprint strategy, then employed a real-time search algorithm that considered how all players' strategies might evolve over the next few moves. Remarkably, it ran on a single server with just 128 GB of RAM and no specialized hardware &mdash; a fraction of the computing resources used by Libratus. When tested against elite professional players including Chris Ferguson, Darren Elias, and others, Pluribus proved decisively superior. It won an average of approximately $5 per hand with a rake of $0, which translates to an exceptionally high win rate at those stakes.</p>

      <h2>How AI Plays Poker: Core Concepts</h2>

      <p>Understanding how AI approaches poker helps you understand why modern strategy looks the way it does. Here are the key concepts that drive AI poker strategy.</p>

      <h3>Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Play</h3>

      <p><strong>GTO</strong> refers to a strategy that is mathematically balanced &mdash; one that cannot be exploited by any opponent regardless of what they do. A GTO player mixes their actions (bets, checks, folds, raises) at specific frequencies designed to make every counter-strategy equally unprofitable. For example, a GTO bluffing strategy ensures that you bluff just enough to make your opponent indifferent between calling and folding with marginal hands.</p>

      <p>Before AI, GTO was a theoretical concept that no human could precisely calculate in real time. AI solvers changed that by computing GTO strategies for every conceivable situation. While no human plays perfectly GTO, understanding GTO solutions provides a strategic baseline &mdash; a "north star" that tells you the mathematically correct play in any spot. Deviations from GTO are only profitable when you have reliable information about your opponent's specific tendencies.</p>

      <h3>Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)</h3>

      <p>CFR is the algorithm at the heart of most poker AI breakthroughs. The core idea is elegant: the AI plays against itself millions or billions of times, and after each hand, it calculates the "regret" for each decision &mdash; how much better it would have done had it chosen a different action. Over time, the AI adjusts its strategy to minimize this cumulative regret, and mathematically, this process converges on a Nash equilibrium strategy.</p>

      <p>The practical implication for human players is significant. CFR-based solvers can tell you the exact frequencies at which you should bet, check, raise, or fold in any given situation. These frequencies are not arbitrary &mdash; they are the product of billions of simulated hands where the AI discovered the mathematically optimal approach through trial and error at a scale no human could achieve.</p>

      <h3>Exploitative vs. Balanced Play</h3>

      <p>One of the most important debates in modern poker &mdash; one that AI has clarified enormously &mdash; is the tension between <strong>exploitative</strong> and <strong>balanced</strong> play. Exploitative play targets specific weaknesses in your opponents (for example, bluffing more against someone who folds too often). Balanced play aims to be unexploitable regardless of who you face.</p>

      <p>AI research has taught us that the optimal approach is a hybrid. You start with a strong GTO-based foundation that protects you against competent opponents, then deviate toward exploitative adjustments when you have clear evidence of specific leaks. The AI Pluribus itself used this approach &mdash; starting with a balanced blueprint strategy and then adjusting in real time based on the specific dynamics of each hand.</p>

        <li><strong>Preflop ranges:</strong> Which hands to open from each position, which hands to 3-bet, and which to fold. AI solvers have produced precise opening ranges that are widely considered the modern standard.</li>
        <li><strong>C-bet frequencies:</strong> How often to continuation bet on different board textures. AI solutions revealed that optimal c-bet strategies are far more nuanced than the "always c-bet" advice from the pre-solver era.</li>
        <li><strong>Bet sizing:</strong> GTO solvers demonstrated that using multiple bet sizes is crucial. Different hand categories on different boards call for small (25-33% pot), medium (50-66% pot), or large (75-150% pot) bets at specific frequencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Check-raise strategies:</strong> One of the biggest revelations from AI solutions was how often and in what spots you should check-raise, particularly on the flop and turn.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2: Identify and Fix Your Leaks (Intermediate)</h3>

      <p>Once you have a baseline understanding of GTO, the next step is identifying where your actual play deviates from optimal. Here is how to do this with AI tools:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Track your hands</strong> using software like PokerTracker or Hold'em Manager. Log at least 10,000 hands to get statistically meaningful data.</li>
        <li><strong>Review key spots in a solver.</strong> Take your biggest losing hands and plug them into PioSOLVER or GTO Wizard. Compare your actual decision to the solver's recommendation. Focus on spots where you deviated significantly from GTO &mdash; these are your biggest leaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for patterns.</strong> Common leaks that AI analysis reveals include: folding too much to 3-bets, not bluffing enough on the river, using incorrect bet sizes on specific board textures, and playing too passively out of position.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice with AI trainers.</strong> Tools like GTO Wizard's practice mode and PokerSnowie let you play against an AI and receive real-time feedback on your decisions. This turns passive study into active learning.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 3: Master Advanced Concepts (Advanced)</h3>

      <p>For serious players looking to reach the highest levels, AI tools unlock sophisticated concepts that were nearly impossible to study before:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Range construction:</strong> Understanding how your entire range of hands interacts with each board texture, not just the specific hand you hold. AI solvers think in terms of ranges, and learning to do the same is the single biggest leap in poker thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-street planning:</strong> Using a solver to analyze how your flop strategy should set up turn and river decisions. AI-informed players plan their entire betting line across all streets.</li>
        <li><strong>Node locking:</strong> An advanced solver feature where you "lock" an opponent's strategy to a specific (non-GTO) tendancy, then let the solver compute the maximally exploitative counter-strategy. This is the bridge between GTO and exploitative play.</li>
        <li><strong>ICM and tournament play:</strong> Modern solvers can incorporate Independent Chip Model calculations for tournament situations, showing how GTO strategy shifts when chips have non-linear value (near bubbles, final tables, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What AI Taught Us About Poker Strategy</h2>

      <p>The breakthroughs from Libratus, Pluribus, and the GTO solver revolution have produced several insights that have fundamentally changed how the best players approach the game. These are not minor adjustments &mdash; they represent a paradigm shift in poker thinking.</p>

      <h3>1. Bluffing Is Mathematical, Not Psychological</h3>

      <p>Before AI, bluffing was primarily discussed as a psychological weapon &mdash; reading opponents, picking the right moment, showing strength. AI demonstrated that optimal bluffing is purely mathematical. You bluff at specific frequencies based on the pot odds you are offering your opponent, the board texture, and your range composition. The "right" amount of bluffing is not about courage or reading tells; it is about making your opponent's calling decisions mathematically indifferent.</p>

      <p>AI solvers revealed that most human players were bluffing far too little in many spots, particularly on the river. The optimal river bluffing frequency in many common situations is higher than what most experienced players would intuitively choose.</p>

      <h3>2. Position Is Even More Valuable Than We Thought</h3>

      <p>Poker players have always known that acting last (having "position") is an advantage. AI quantified exactly how much. Solver analysis shows that the button (dealer position) should play significantly wider ranges than any other position, and the expected win rate from the button is dramatically higher than from any other seat. AI solutions also revealed just how carefully you must play from early position and the blinds to compensate for the positional disadvantage.</p>

      <h3>3. Bet Sizing Is a Weapon</h3>

      <p>Pre-AI poker strategy often defaulted to standardized bet sizes &mdash; "bet two-thirds pot on the flop, pot on the turn." AI demonstrated that bet sizing is one of the most important strategic decisions in the game. On some board textures, the optimal strategy is to bet small (25-33% pot) with a wide range. On others, you should bet large (75%+ pot) or even overbet (100%+ pot) with a polarized range. The choice of bet size communicates information about your range and manipulates the pot odds for your opponent.</p>

      <p>One of the most revolutionary AI-driven discoveries was the frequency of <strong>overbetting</strong>. Before solvers, overbetting the pot was considered a niche or "tricky" play. AI showed that in many river situations, overbetting is the primary optimal strategy, and that humans were leaving significant value on the table by capping their bet sizes at the pot.</p>

      <h3>4. Mixed Strategies Are Real</h3>

      <p>Perhaps the most difficult concept for human players to adopt from AI is the idea of <strong>mixed strategies</strong> &mdash; playing the same hand differently at calculated frequencies. A GTO solver might say you should check with pocket aces on a certain flop 35% of the time and bet 65% of the time. This is not indecision; it is mathematically optimal. Mixed strategies prevent opponents from accurately putting you on a hand based on your action, maintaining the balance that makes GTO play unexploitable.</p>

      <p>In practice, most human players cannot execute precise mixed strategies. The practical takeaway is to ensure your ranges are not too predictable. If you always bet when you have a strong hand and always check when you are weak, opponents with solver knowledge will destroy you.</p>

      <h3>5. Defense Frequencies Matter</h3>

      <p>AI clarified exactly how often you need to defend against bets to prevent opponents from profitably bluffing you. The concept of <strong>minimum defense frequency (MDF)</strong> &mdash; the percentage of your range you need to continue with to prevent an opponent from auto-profiting with bluffs &mdash; became a cornerstone of modern poker thinking. For a half-pot bet, you need to continue with approximately 67% of your range. For a full-pot bet, approximately 50%. Solvers compute the exact hands that should continue (by calling or raising) in each situation.</p>

      <h2>The Ethics of AI in Online Poker</h2>

      <p>No discussion of AI poker strategy is complete without addressing the elephant in the room: the use of AI-powered tools <strong>during</strong> live play. Every legitimate online poker site prohibits the use of real-time solver assistance during play. Using a solver while playing is cheating, full stop. The tools discussed in this article are for <strong>study and post-session analysis only</strong>.</p>

      <p>That said, the line between "studying with AI tools" and "using AI during play" has raised complex debates. Some argue that memorizing solver outputs before sessions and applying them during play is a form of AI-assisted play. Others contend that this is no different from studying any other training material. The poker community generally agrees that studying with solvers away from the table is legitimate, while using any AI tool during play is not.</p>

      <p>There is also the question of AI bots infiltrating online poker games. Despite site operators investing heavily in bot detection, the sophistication of poker AIs means that some bots inevitably slip through, particularly at lower stakes. If you suspect a bot at your table, report it to the site immediately. Major platforms like PokerStars, GGPoker, and others have dedicated security teams that investigate suspected bots and refund affected players.</p>

      <h2>Building an AI-Informed Study Routine</h2>

      <p>Here is a practical weekly study routine that incorporates AI tools for maximum improvement:</p>

      <h3>Monday: Range Review (45 min)</h3>

      <p>Open GTO Wizard or a pre-solved database and review preflop ranges for two positions you struggled with during the previous week. Focus on understanding which hands are opens, 3-bets, calls, and folds. Pay special attention to the boundary hands &mdash; the ones that are close between actions. These are where the real edge lies.</p>

      <h3>Tuesday &amp; Thursday: Hand Review in Solver (60 min each)</h3>

      <p>Select 5-10 of your most significant hands from recent sessions. "Significant" means hands where you faced a tough decision, lost a big pot, or felt unsure about your play. Run each hand through PioSOLVER or GTO Wizard and compare your decision to the solver's recommendation. Write down the key takeaway from each hand. Over time, this builds an enormous database of studied situations that improves your intuition.</p>

      <h3>Wednesday: AI Trainer Practice (45 min)</h3>

      <p>Use GTO Wizard's practice mode or PokerSnowie to play against an AI in specific scenarios you are working on. If you are studying check-raise spots, set the trainer to deal you those scenarios repeatedly. Active practice with instant feedback accelerates learning much faster than passive study.</p>

      <h3>Friday: Node Locking / Exploitative Study (45 min)</h3>

      <p>Take a common opponent type you face (for example, a player who folds too much to river bets) and use node locking in your solver to compute the maximally exploitative strategy against that tendency. Understanding both the GTO play and the exploitative adjustment gives you a complete strategic picture.</p>

      <h3>Weekend: Play (Sessions)</h3>

      <p>Apply what you have studied during actual play. Focus on one or two concepts per session rather than trying to change everything at once. After each session, tag interesting hands for review the following week. The cycle repeats.</p>

      <h2>The Future of AI in Poker</h2>

      <p>The AI poker revolution is far from over. Here are the trends that will shape poker strategy in the coming years:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time GTO approximation:</strong> AI tools are getting faster and more accessible. Within a few years, near-perfect GTO solutions for any spot will be available on mobile devices in real time (for study purposes, not during play).</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized AI coaching:</strong> Machine learning models that analyze your entire hand history and generate customized study plans targeting your specific weaknesses. Instead of generic training, you will have an AI coach that knows your game intimately.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-way solver improvements:</strong> Current solvers handle heads-up situations well but struggle with multi-way pots (three or more players). As computing power increases and algorithms improve, accurate multi-way solutions will become available, closing one of the last unsolved gaps in poker strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-powered anti-cheating:</strong> The same AI technology used to play poker is being used to detect bots and collusion. Pattern recognition algorithms can identify non-human playing patterns with increasing accuracy, helping keep online poker fair.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration of poker AI with LLMs:</strong> Large language models are beginning to serve as poker coaches that can explain complex solver outputs in plain language, answer strategic questions, and simulate opponent types for practice. This makes AI poker knowledge accessible to players who are not technically inclined.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is using a poker solver considered cheating?</h3>

      <p>Using a solver <strong>during</strong> live play is absolutely considered cheating and is prohibited by every legitimate poker site. Using a solver for <strong>study and analysis</strong> away from the table is completely legal and widely practiced by professionals and serious amateurs. Think of it like studying film in sports &mdash; reviewing game tape to improve is standard practice, but you cannot watch a replay during the actual game.</p>

      <h3>Can a beginner benefit from GTO tools?</h3>

      <p>Yes, but the approach matters. A complete beginner should not jump straight into PioSOLVER &mdash; it will be overwhelming and counterproductive. Start with a structured training platform like GTO Wizard or PokerSnowie that presents solver-derived strategies in digestible formats. Focus first on preflop ranges and basic postflop concepts. As your understanding grows, gradually incorporate more advanced solver study.</p>

      <h3>Is GTO always the best strategy?</h3>

      <p>No. GTO is the <strong>safest</strong> strategy because it cannot be exploited, but it is not always the most <strong>profitable</strong> strategy. Against weak opponents who make significant mistakes, an exploitative strategy that targets their specific leaks will win more money per hand than GTO play. The ideal approach is to use GTO as your default and deviate toward exploitation when you have reliable information about your opponents' tendencies.</p>

      <h3>Which solver should I buy first?</h3>

      <p>For most players, <strong>GTO Wizard</strong> is the best starting point because it combines pre-solved solutions with a practice mode and does not require you to set up complex solver configurations. If you want to run your own custom solutions (necessary for advanced study), <strong>PioSOLVER</strong> is the industry standard for Hold'em, and <strong>MonkerSolver</strong> is the best choice for Omaha. Budget-conscious players can start with <strong>SimplePostflop</strong> or <strong>Jesolver</strong>.</p>

      <h3>How long does it take to see improvement from solver study?</h3>

      <p>Most dedicated students see measurable improvement within 2-4 weeks of consistent solver study (at least 3-5 hours per week). The biggest initial gains usually come from fixing preflop leaks and understanding basic bet sizing. Deep strategic improvement &mdash; truly understanding range-based thinking and multi-street planning &mdash; typically takes 3-6 months of committed study. The key is consistency. Four hours per week every week produces far better results than twenty hours in one week followed by nothing.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>AI has not ruined poker. It has elevated it. The game is harder than ever at the highest levels, but it is also more learnable than ever. The same AI tools that power superhuman bots are now available to anyone willing to invest the time to study. The players who embrace AI-informed study will have an enormous edge over those who rely solely on intuition and experience.</p>

      <p>The strategic depth that AI has revealed in poker is genuinely awe-inspiring. Every spot has a mathematically correct solution, and yet the game remains deeply human because executing that solution in real time, under pressure, with real money on the line, is still extraordinarily difficult. AI gave us the map. You still have to walk the path.</p>

      <p>Start with a solid understanding of GTO fundamentals, build a consistent study routine, and remember that the goal is not to play like a computer &mdash; it is to use the computer's insights to make better human decisions at the table. The AI poker revolution has given every player access to the same strategic knowledge. What separates the winners from the rest is who puts in the work.</p>
